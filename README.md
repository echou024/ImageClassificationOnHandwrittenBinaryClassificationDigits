# Image Classification On Handwritten Digits
Performs image classification on a handwritten digits dataset using a two-layer neural network with loss functions, gradients, optimizers. 

The dataset consists 10 handwritten digits (0,1,...,9).
The training data consists of 60000 images of size $28 \times 28$ pixels; the test data consists of 10000 images.

We will use the functionality of Pandas (https://pandas.pydata.org/), Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/), and Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/).
